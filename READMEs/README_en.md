# Features of this mod
## Controller Compatible
Controllers can be used for button use!

## Multiple people can be set up 
All crewmates can also be used as sheriffs, etc.!<br>
In SHR mode, "everyone's sheriff" is not supported due to the specification that the sheriff replaces the Impostor.<br>
After the match starts, the crewmate is immediately judged the winner of the task.<br>
(No one with a task = 0 tasks left for Crew.)<br>
Please include one Team Crewposition that has a task.<br>
(Adding a MadMate, JackalFriends, or Home Security Guard not help.)<br>

##  Equipment settings
You can set up the admin, vitals, and other settings.<br>
In normal mode, time settings are also available.<br>
The [ykundesuBeplnEx] setting is also included!<br>
Currently, in SHR mode, you can only use the available/unavailable settings.<br>

## Multiple people can be set up in one position.
All crewmates can also be Sheriffs, etc.!<br>

- Note: SHR mode
  - Due to the specification of Sheriff replacing Impostor, "Sheriff for all" is not supported with [Task Win] in the Crew win condition.
    - After the match starts, the Crew is immediately judged to have won the task. (No one with a task = 0 task remaining for Crew)
    - Please include one person in the Crew team position who has a task. (Adding a Mad Mate, Jackal Friends, or Home Guard will not help).
- However, if "Duplicate Mode/No Task Wins Mode" is turned on, it is possible to set "All Crew Mates are Sheriffs" in SHR mode.
  - Crew win conditions in this setting
    - Eradication of Impostor, Jackal, or other single victorious third team with a Sheriff kill.

### Team Crew
#### Intro
- I will protect you according to my beliefs.
#### Description
- During the conference phase, you can put up a shield to prevent one kill by using the protect button. 
If the protection is successful, a successful protection announcement will be played at the beginning of the next meeting phase.

#### Ability
- Once per meeting phase, you can put up a shield that prevents one kill.
- The shield disappears when a kill is prevented or at the beginning of the Conference Phase.
- The shield also prevents kills during the conference phase.
- If the same person receives both a kill and a protection in the same conference phase, priority is given to the one who declares his/her action earlier.
(Kills are handled in real time and do not wait for the guarding ability to be selected.)
- If the target's kill process has already been executed after the protective ability is used, the ability will not fire but can be used again.
